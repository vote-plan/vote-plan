## Overview of [Vote Plan](https://www.voteplan.org)

This website provides a way to pre-plan votes before going to vote.

This is helpful because it can be difficult to take the time to decipher a ballot paper in a busy voting place.

Preparing your vote beforehand takes the guess work out of filling out the ballot paper.

This website tries to be un-biased.

At the moment it has only elections in Australia.
