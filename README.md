## Overview of [Vote Plan](https://www.voteplan.org)

THis website provides a way to pre-plan votes before going to vote.

This is helpful because it can be difficult to take the time to decipher a ballot paper in a busy voting place.

Preparing your vote beforehand takes the guess work out of filling out the ballot paper.

THis website does not try to bias or nudge people on how they should vote. It is only concerned with making voting easier.

The website supports creating voting plans for more than one election. Have a look at the [election-data](elections-data) directory to see the available elections.
