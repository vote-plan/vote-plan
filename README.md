## Overview of [Vote Plan](https://www.voteplan.org)

THis website provides a way to pre-plan votes before going to vote.

This is helpful because it can be difficult to take the time to decipher a ballot paper in a busy voting place.

Preparing your vote beforehand takes the guess work out of filling out the ballot paper.

THis website tries to be un-biased and not nudge people on how they should vote. It is only concerned with making voting easier.

The website supports creating voting plans for more than one election.
