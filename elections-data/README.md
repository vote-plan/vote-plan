# Vote Plan data

This repository stores the raw and formatted data for the Vote Plan website.

The raw data is manually downloaded from various sources, and stored in the election's `raw` directory.

Then a Python script per election is written to convert the raw data into the standard json format.

See `elections-data/common/example.yml` for the data.json format.
